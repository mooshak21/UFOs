# Exploring UFO Sighting Data
## Overview
> In this project we are using HTML, CSS, and different Javascript libraries to analyze UFO sightings with data that we are provided. We will use D3.js to allow us to transfer the array of js objects into a table on our index.html page. Our main goal is to add the appropriate filters on the HTML page that correspond to the characteristics of each sighting (city, country, state, date, shape). Using these filters we want an updated table that will correctly 
filter the data based on the user's inputs to be returned.

## Results
After working through the code we were able to create a working website that correctly filtered the data.
Here is a walkthrough on how to use the filters when searching:

1. You will be brought to the main "UFO Sightings" page which will include the complete dataset in the table.

2. The page will already have the format for the input values. Once you put in a value that is contained in the dataset, the filtered table will be returned. In this case, I searched for the sightings in **City**: el cajon and **State**: ca. Note that the state field will require the two character code for the state.

3. You can do the same with the other filters sing the format to get the desired results.
